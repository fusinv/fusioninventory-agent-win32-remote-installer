= About =

This tool helps you install FusionInventory agent on Windows systems, remote or local:
 -set the server path with the optional credentials
 -configure the proxy settings
 -register the SSL certificat

It accepts IP subnets and IP ranges as remote Windows target systems on which FusionInventory agent would be installed. Following forms of remote windows hosts are accepted:
 - Single host name: test.mycompany.com
 - Single host IP: 192.168.1.17
 - IP list: 192.168.1.16, 192.168.1.17, 192.168.1.18
 - IP range: 192.168.1.16 - 192.168.1.18
 - Network specified by subnet: 192.168.1.0 / 255.255.255.0
 - Network specified by CIDR: 192.168.1.0 / 24
As result, the following is a valid value for "Host(s)" in "Remote host
to be inventoried":
test.mycompany.com, 10.10.2.26, 10.10.3.167, 192.168.1.0 /
255.255.255.0, 192.168.3.0 / 24


Or even you can leave it to the application to sweep your entire subnet
by selecting "Try the entire network subnet". If you have these network
interfaces:
eth0	inet addr:10.10.1.37  Bcast:10.10.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
eth0:1	inet addr:10.10.2.37  Bcast:10.10.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
eth1	inet addr:10.10.3.37  Bcast:10.10.3.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
lo 	inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0

It would be the same as specifying the following as "Host(s)":
10.10.1.37/24, 10.10.2.37/24, 10.10.3.37/24,
The trailing "," would be ignored.
